- ✅ Comprehensive fallback mechanisms using roadmapService

**Real API Integration**: ✅ Fully integrated with your API key and enhanced timeout handling

#### 5. **Qwen 3 Free API Optimization** ✅
**Problem**: Need better error handling and timeouts
**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ Updated to Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B Instruct model (better performance)
- ✅ Intelligent retry logic with 2 automatic retries
- ✅ 45-second timeout with proper AbortController handling
- ✅ Enhanced error messages with specific suggestions
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging API issues

**Real API Integration**: ✅ Your API key: `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`
